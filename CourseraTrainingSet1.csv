It's to the point, easy to follow, and very informative! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in taking a Screenplay Writing course!  The course curriculum is simple: We will adopt a professional writers room process in which you�ll write, post your work for peer review, share feedback with your peers and revise your work with the feedback you receive from your peers. That's how we do it in the real world. You will feel as if you were in a professional writers room yet no prior experience as a writer is required. I'm a proponent of Experiential Learning (Active Learning). My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer. I will guide you but I won�t ""show"" you how to write. I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write.  Learner Review: ""I would like to thank this course instructor. It's an amazing course""  What you�ll need to get started: As mentioned above, no prior script writing experience is required. To begin with, any basic word processor will do. During week two, you can choose to download some free scriptwriting software such as Celtx or Trelby or you may choose to purchase Final Draft, the industry standard, or you can continue to use your word processor and do your own script formatting.

Silicon Thin Film Solar Cells,�cole Polytechnique,Advanced,4.1,https://www.coursera.org/learn/silicon-thin-film-solar-cells,"This course consists of a general presentation of solar cells based on silicon thin films.   It is the third MOOC of the photovoltaic series of Ecole polytechnique on Coursera. The general aspects of the photovoltaic field are treated in ""Photovoltaic Solar Energy"". And the detailed description of the crystalline silicon solar cells can be found in ""Physics of Silicon Solar Cells"".  After a brief presentation of solar cells operation, thin film semiconductors are described here. The general properties of disordered and crystalline semiconductors are found very different, in particular in terms of band structure and doping mechanisms. Silicon thin films, generally less than 1 �m thick, are deposited from silane plasma leading to hydrogen incorporation. The growth mechanisms are discussed, in particular the capability to prepare partially crystallized thin films which appear as a mixture of nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous tissue.  The consequences of the semiconductor properties on solar cells behavior are reviewed. The optical properties of amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon are complementary. Thus the plasma process is particularly well adapted to the preparation of multijunctions, with conversion efficiencies around 13-15 %. Furthermore plasma processes allow to prepare solar cells in large area on glass or flexible substrates.  Finally, it is shown that crystalline and amorphous silicon materials can be combine into heterojunctions solar cells with high efficiency conversion (about 25 %).  **This course is part of a series of 3** Photovoltaic solar energy (https://www.coursera.org/learn/photovoltaic-solar-energy/) Physics of silicon solar cells (https://www.coursera.org/learn/physics-silicon-solar-cells/) Silicon thin film solar cells",chemistry  physics  Solar Energy  film  lambda calculus  Electrical Engineering  electronics  energy  silicon  thinning physical-science-and-engineering electrical-engineering,Electrical Engineering,Solar Energy

Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries,Coursera Project Network,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-table-sql-queries,"In this course you�ll learn how to effectively retrieve data from a relational database table using the SQL language.   We all know that most computer systems rely on at least one database to store data. Your tax information is stored in the database used by the Internal Revenue Service. Your phone stores your contacts�   names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers in a database. If you shop online, you�re viewing photos, descriptions, and prices of products that are stored in a database. Database designers go to great lengths to design databases so that the data can be stored securely and in an organized format. It�s important to note that the main reason they go to all that work is so that we can get the data back out again when we need it! That�s called �data retrieval�.   Data is retrieved or read from a relational database by using a language called SQL to query (or question) the database. SQL is referred to as �the language of relational databases�. It can be used by itself or embedded in programs to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be displayed on a web page or PC application, or even printed on paper.   You�ll be practicing writing SQL queries using SQLiteStudio.   Next time you go online and look up the daily special at your favorite restaurant, you can think about the fact that it�s likely that an SQL query was used behind the scenes to fetch that data and pop it up on your screen. By the end of this course, you�ll even have a pretty good idea what the query might have looked like!  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We�re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",Data Analysis  select (sql)  database management systems  online shopping  table (database)  data retrieval  Databases  web page  numbers (spreadsheet)  SQL information-technology data-management,Programming,SQL

"Programming Languages, Part A",University of Washington,Intermediate,4.9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages,"This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language �fits together� to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.  This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.  The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.  The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.  Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.",inference  ml (programming language)  higher-order function  functional programming  type inference  pattern matching  euler's totient function  language  ?-recursive function  Computer Programming computer-science software-development,Programming,Languages
